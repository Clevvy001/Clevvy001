ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Emmanuel Chisom.

I am currently enrolled in a Data Analytics Nanodegree program sponsored by Udacity and also a final year student of Chemical Engineering at Federal University of Technology Minna. I have great skills in Graphic Design and Digital Marketing. I have worked as a freelancer on many Graphic Design projects such as design of fliers, logos, book covers, business cards, product branding and many more. I have oustanding knowledge in the use of Microsoft Office packages and I also possess excellent communication and networking skills.

I have strong passion for learning and teaching, hence, I am enthusiatic about learning new skills and ideas that can improve my knowledge base and also help me further my career in the field of Data Analytics. I am interested in meeting new people, making good friends and team mates and also networking with professionals in any field of learning.

As an amateur in the Tech space, I'm currently looking for opportunities to hone my skills in Data Analytics by freelancing, collaborating on open source projects and also working part time in a tech or business company.

What about you?
